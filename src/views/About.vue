    <p>This project is an attempt to make a connection between the hardworking Curiosity Rover on Mars and people down here on Earth.</p>
    <p>According to Wikipedia, Curiosity is a ​car​-sized ​rover​ designed to ​explore​ ​the crater Gale​ on Mars​ as part of ​NASA​'s ​Mars Science Laboratory​ mission. Curiosity was launched from ​Cape Canaveral​ on November 26, 2011, and landed inside Gale on Mars on August 6, 2012. The rover's ​goals​ are to investigate Martian ​climate​ and ​geology​, including ​planetary habitability studies in preparation for human exploration. In December 2012, Curiosity's two-year mission was extended indefinitely.</p>
