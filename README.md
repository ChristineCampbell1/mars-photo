> Building an app to display data from an API

The purpose of this project is to build a single page application using a JavaScript application framework. The application should allow the user to submit some information and then fetch data from a third-party API.

## Basic Requirements
The following requirements must be met in order to successfully complete this assignment.
•	Utilize a JavaScript framework to build a single page application.
o	At least two URLs in the application.
o	At least one call to a data API.
o	Use some form of user input to customize the API request.
o	At least one feature designed to enhance the user experience (e.g. messaging, animation, local caching of data, etc.)
o	Make sensible and conventional use of the features of the framework (templates, routing, etc.)
•	Implement some form of dependency management (Webpack, Bower, Browserify, etc.).
•	Implement some form of file optimization (CSS/JS minification, file versioning, etc.)
•	Implement deployment scripts that allow easy deployment of built code to the public web.
•	Use a convenient development server and setup for building the website.
•	Document how to set up the project for development in your README file.
•	Document how to deploy the site to production servers in your README file.
•	Provide good comments to help other developers better understand your application.

## Stretch Goals
If you are looking for additional challenges, consider the following goals.
•	Add a second API call to another service. Many sites are built around combining two different services, and it can be useful, humorous, or interesting to combine API calls. Weather and photos? Rhyming words and pictures? Generate a poem based on the weather?
•	Implement a full API data and user data caching mechanism. Save data and eliminate extra API calls.
•	Add more states to your app to allow deeper functionality: Provide deeper views of data, or other ways of looking at API results.
•	Implement a non-approved API to provide different data to your application.

## Approved APIs
The world of third-party data APIs is vast, and many APIs are easier to work with than others. This list of approved APIs includes APIs that are designed to work with frontend JavaScript calls requiring little to no authentication credentials. There are many APIs that are NOT on this list and could work perfectly well, but in order to figure that out you must absolutely review the API with your instructor. Even after you review with your instructor, you may discover unforeseen challenges as you work with non-approved APIs. Be careful about deciding to use a non-approved API if you feel less confident or fear you will not have enough time to invest in working through the extra challenges.
